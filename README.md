# active-directory-vm-lab

This project documents my hands-on experience deploying and configuring **Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)** within a **Windows Server virtual machine environment hosted on AWS**.

---

## 🎯 Objective

Build and configure a functional Active Directory domain by installing AD DS, promoting a Windows Server to a Domain Controller, and managing directory objects such as users, groups, and Organizational Units (OUs).

---

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated

- Installing and configuring Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)
- Promoting a Windows Server to a Domain Controller
- Creating and managing a new forest and domain
- Structuring Organizational Units (OUs)
- Managing users and groups using Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC)
- Understanding domain-based authentication and access control

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- Windows Server (AWS EC2 AMI)
- Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)
- Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC)
- Server Manager
- Amazon EC2 (Virtual Machine)

## 📋 Lab Overview

This lab was completed in a virtualized AWS EC2 environment to simulate a real-world Windows domain infrastructure.  
The focus was on centralized identity management, authentication, and directory services.

---

## 🚀 Steps Performed

1. Deployed a Windows Server instance on AWS EC2  
2. Configured initial server settings (hostname and networking)  
3. Installed the Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) role  
4. Promoted the server to a Domain Controller  
5. Created a new forest and domain  
6. Verified domain functionality  
7. Created and managed Organizational Units (OUs)  
8. Added and managed user and group accounts using ADUC  
9. Each step was validated to ensure proper domain functionality before proceeding to the next phase.

## 📚 What I Learned

This lab strengthened my understanding of how Active Directory is deployed and managed in enterprise environments and reinforced best practices for centralized identity and access management.

## 🔮 Next Steps

- Join a client machine to the domain  
- Implement Group Policy Objects (GPOs)  
- Expand the lab with additional users, groups, and security policies
